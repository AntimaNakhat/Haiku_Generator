A haiku is a type of very short poem that originated in Japan. It has three lines. The first line has 5 syllables, the second has 7 syllables, and the third has 5 syllables again. Haiku usually describe a moment in nature or a feeling, using clear, simple images. Even though it is brief, a good haiku often gives the reader a quiet, thoughtful feeling.
